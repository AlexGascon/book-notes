# Illusion of Control

Illusion of Control is the tendency to believe that we can influence something over which we have absolutely no control. For example, when we pick a specific number in the lottery, or when we repeatedly pressed "A" when trying to catch a Pokémon to get it to stay inside the Pokéball.

There are more examples of "Illusion of control" than what we may believe: for example, the button in most passenger's traffic lights to make them change to green, and even some economy decisions.

Being aware of illusions of control will let us focus on the things that actually can be controlled by our actions.
