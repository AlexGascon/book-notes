# Chaffeur knowledge

Chaffeur knowledge is what happens when someone memorizes something but without actually understanding it: they can explain it using the same words and terms that they memorized, but if they are asked any related question or are asked to dive deeper into the topic, they won't be able to.

It's the case, for example, with news presenters: they tell thousands of news, but they don't actually know them with detail, they are just actors that read from a script. It also happens a lot of times with some journalists, or even with big company's CEOs.

This bias has a great example in a famous story about Max Planck and his chauffer: after getting his Nobel prize, Planck started was invited to a lot of universities to present the results, and he always gave the exact same talk. At one point, his chauffer said "I've heard that talk so many times that I could give it myself" and they agreed that at the next conference they will exchange roles, and the chauffer will simulate to be Planck. He did it, but after finishing a professor from the public asked a question, and as he didn't know what to say, he answered: "That question is so simple, that my chauffer will answer it".
