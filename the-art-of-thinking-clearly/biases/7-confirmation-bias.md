# Confirmation bias

Confirmation bias is the tendency to interpret new information so it becomes compatible with our current beliefs or convictions, and filter out the information that may point that we are wrong ("that's just an exception, but my belief still applies for the general case").

For example, one professor asked her students about the rule that defines the following sequence

2, 4, 6

They could say numbers that complete them and the professor would say if they were right or wrong.

Most students said 8, 10, 12. All those numbers, in that sequence, were correct.

Another student said -2: Incorrect. 1: Incorrect. 29: Correct. 42: Correct.

Turns out that the sequence rule was to say a number higher than the previous one. However, must students believed that it was to add 2 to the previous number, because they didn't try to mention any number that may have invalidate their thoughts.
