# Sunk Cost Fallacy
Sometimes, we don't want to get rid of something because we've invested a lot on it, be it money, time or whatever. Some examples are:

- "This book is really bad but I don't want to drop it, I'm already halfway through it"
- "I've lost a lot of money on stock/Bitcoin but I don't want to sell, I spent a lot of money"
- "I've already studied two years, I don't want to change to another degree"

We need to be completely honest with ourselves: no matter what happens, we've already lost what we've invested. What we need to ask ourselves is: considering **only the future** costs and benefits, is continuing with this the best decision I can make?
