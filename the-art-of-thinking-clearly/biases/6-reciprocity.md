# Reciprocity

Most of the time, you may receive an offer that is supposedly free - A free drink, an invitation to dinner, etc. However, you also need to think on the consequences that accepting it may have: maybe whoever invited you wanted to ask a favour afterwards, and if that's the case, you probably will feel bad saying no. That's why you may accept, even if on other conditions you wouldn't have. 

When you get a something for free, be completely sure that you're not falling into a "trap". And if it is, either accept it and accept that you may need to live with the remorse of not paying back, or refuse from the start.
