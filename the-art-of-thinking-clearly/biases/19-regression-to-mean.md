# Regression to mean
When something important is in a really bad situation, you may want to do whatever you can to fix it. However, you need to realize that if the situation is really really bad, maybe it will get better even if you don't do anything.

For example, imagine that you play your worst football match ever: for the next match, you decide to wear your lucky socks, and then you play better. You may think that your socks made you better, but as you already hit your all-time-lowest, it was actually highly improbable that you played worse.

You need to distinguish between those situations when your actions were what improved the result, and those when the result improved simply because it was very difficult for it to get even worse.

And of course, the opposite can happen too: if you play your best football match ever, with high probability you will play worse on the next match.
