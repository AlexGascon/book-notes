# Incentive Super-Response Tendency
If you have to set up an incentive system for something, be very careful: you may get the opposite effect.

Once, during a rat plague, a local government stablished a monetary reward for every dead rat that citizens brought to the authorities. The result? People started breeding rats at home, just to kill them afterwards and get the reward.

This happens because people respond to incentives by doing what results in best interest for them. Therefore, try to set an incentive system that considers not only result, but also intention.
