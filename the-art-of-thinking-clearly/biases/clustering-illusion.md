# Clustering Illusion
Our brain tends to imagine patterns when there aren't. That's why we see shapes in clouds, or tendencies in stock markets. But most of the time, it's just our brain imagining sequences. 

If we really believe that we are onto some interesting pattern, then better test the data statistically to be sure
