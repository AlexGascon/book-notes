# Hindsight bias

Some things that happened in the past may seem incredibly obvious right now. For example, if we now analyze the status of the economy on 2007, the upcoming crash seems incredibly obvious. Yet at the moment no one was able to accurately predict it.

Similarly, we now study how a single shot in Sarajevo in 1914 resulted in World War I as if it was crystal clear that it was going to happen ("the political and social tension made it a matter of time that a war stared") but at the time it would have sounded ridiculous to say that a single incident would have resulted in the greatest war ever.

The hindsight bias says that things seem much more clear when they are in the past than on the moment when they are happening, but it's just because we see have already confirmed them. But in reality, things are definitely not as obvious.
