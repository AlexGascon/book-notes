# Outcome bias

You have to judge decisions not by its result, but by the decision process.

Imagine that you pick a random number between 1 and 10, and then ask 10000 people to guess it: we can assume that about 10% will succeed. Take those 1000 correct guessers, choose another number, and make them guess again: about 10% will choose the correct one. Take those 100 correct guessers and repeat the process. At the end, there will be approximately one person who guessed correctly all the numbers: just by looking at the result, you may say that he is a master of number-guessing, but in reality it was just a matter of probability. He had the same skills that all the other participants.

Think of this when something goes well in your life: did it happen because something you did, or it was just sheer luck? If it's the first case, stick with that method. But if it's the second one, you can forget about it.

The opposite may happen too: when you do something wrong, analyze your actions: were they the incorrect ones? Or you were just unlucky?
