# Availability bias

The availability bias says that we create a picture of the world using the examples that most easily come to mind. This is absurd, because something doesn't happen more frequently just because we can conceive it more easily.

For example, we are usually more concerned about dying from a terrorist attack than from dying from diabetes, when the latter is way more likely.

A more worrying example can happen on a corporate environment: it's usually preferred to discuss about information that it's easy to obtain, instead about what's actually important. For example, a board meeting may discuss about quarterly figures, instead of a clever move by the competition or an unexpected change in customer behavior.
