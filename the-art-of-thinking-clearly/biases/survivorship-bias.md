## Survivorship bias
The fact that a lot of successful people share a trait, doesn't mean that trait is what makes them successful; you need to analyze if the people that failed have that trait too, because if that's the case it means that the trait has nothing to do with success.

"Survivors" get a lot more attention than failed people, and that may make us believe that the traits they share is what made them "survive". But we need to analyze the "cemetery" too to check if people or projects that were promising but ended failing had that trait too.

Usually the difference between successful and unsuccessful is what is present in survivors but not in the "cemetery", and to find out that we need to analyze the cemetery too.
