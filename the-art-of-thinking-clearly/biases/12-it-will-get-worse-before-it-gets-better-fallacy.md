# The "It-will-get-worse-before-it-gets-better" fallacy

There are times when you'll hear someone in charge of improving a situation saying that it will get worse before being solved. A lot of those times, the person who made that prediction doesn't actually have any idea of what's happening.

Predicting that things will go worse when having no idea of how to solve the situation is a "win-win" option for the one who makes the prediction: if they actually go worse, you can say "I told you" and wait; if they improve, you can take the rewards and say that it was your actions what make the situation improve.

If you're on the other side, however, beware: maybe you'll be better by looking for a different person to solve your problem. Someone who actually know what's happening.
