## Swimmer's Body Illusion
(_In the book the bias talks about swimmer's, but honestly I'm not completely [and after checking with some swimmer's) I'm not sure that the swimmer's body is just a consequence of genetics, so I feel more comfortable explaining it with a basketball player's body_)

We need to be aware of not mistaking the result of an action with the factor of selection for it. For example, it's not that playing basketball makes you taller: it's that taller people has an advantage for playing basketball, and therefore usually professional players are way higher than average. And that's not the only case where it happens: for example, it's not that make-up makes you gorgeous, but that only really pretty people gets selected for make-up advertisements.

It's important to take it into consideration when pursuing something: while certainly it won't be impossible for you to be a good basketball player if you aren't tall, you need to recognize this bias to realise that you will have to try harder to overcome that disadvantage.
