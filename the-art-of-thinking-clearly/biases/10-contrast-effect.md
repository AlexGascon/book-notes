# Contrast effect
Most of the time, we judge things not by its absolute value, but by its value relative to something that is familiar to us.

For example, a lot of people may walk an extra mile to save $10 on a $20 meal. However, probably few of them will walk an extra mile to save $10 on a $8000 car. It shouldn't make sense, because the value of the $10 it's exactly the same, but we see it differently because it's _relative_ value is different. 

The same may happen with more intangible things, like beauty, a job or even happiness.
