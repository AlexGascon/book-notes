# Confirmation bias (Part II)

We saw a simple example of the confirmation bias. However, it is something that affects us at a much deeper level: you may want to believe that people are inherently good or, that people are inherently bad, and if you only look at the surface you'll find news and facts that will support your believes - in both cases.

The same happens with political, economical or social views, which define our society. It's incredibly important to try to overcome the confirmation bias, because otherwise we may be defending really bad options.
