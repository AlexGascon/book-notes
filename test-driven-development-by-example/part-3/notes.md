# Part 3 - Patterns for TDD #
## Introduction ##
This section changes from the practical approach used in previous chapters to one more focused on theory, with the introduction and description of patterns that are useful in your day-to-day TDD journey

I won't document all of them (as it would require copying the book almost word by word), but instead I will publish some notes of the concepts I considered the most interesting. They are divided in several chapters, focusing on differents parts of the TDD process.

## Test-Driven Development Patterns ##
* Prepare the tests one by one, instead of trying to write all the tests first. Never be more than one change away from green. Otherwise, you'll have unnecessary stress and it will affect your ability to reason effectively.
* Assert first. The assertion is the most important part of the test, so by doing it first we start focusing on how we want it to look vs Where we're going to implement that functionality, how are we going to call the variables, etc

## Red bar patterns ##
* If you really don't know what to do (how to write that test, how to implement that feature, etc), take a break. Fatigue breaks your judgment, and you need to move away from it to keep being sharp
