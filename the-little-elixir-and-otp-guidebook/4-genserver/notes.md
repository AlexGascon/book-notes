# Chapter 4 - Writing server applications with GenServer

Specially interesting to take a look at Table 4.2 - Mentions all the expected return values for each callback method

Actually, take a look at all the tables during the Chapter. They give a really good overview of the GenServer logic, it's quite easy to understand it just by looking at the tables.

The example projects (Metex and Cachex) are also a really good way of understanding the logic, they are implementations of all the theory of the chapter.
