# No filter - The inside story of Instagram

![](cover.jpg)

## Synopsis
Since its creation in 2010, Instagram’s fun and simple interface has captured our collective imagination, swiftly becoming a way of life. In No Filter: The Inside Story of Instagram, technology reporter Sarah Frier explains how Instagram’s founders married art and technology to overcome skeptics and to hook the public on visual storytelling. At first, Instagram initially attracted artisans, but then the platform exploded in popularity among the masses, creating an entire industry of digital influencers that’s now worth tens of billions of dollars.

Eighteen months after Instagram’s launch and explosive growth, the founders—Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger—made the gut-wrenching decision to sell the company to Facebook. For most companies, that would be the end of the story; but for Instagram, it was only the beginning. Instagram borrowed some lessons from Facebook and rejected others, until eventually its success stirred tension with Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg, just as Facebook became embroiled in a string of public crises. Frier unearths the details that led to the cofounders’ departure, bringing to light dramatic moments unknown to the public until now.

At its heart, No Filter draws on unprecedented exclusive access—from the founders of Instagram, as well as employees, executives, and competitors; hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio; Anna Wintour of Vogue; Kris Jenner of the Kardashian-Jenner empire; and a plethora of influencers, from fashionistas with millions of followers to owners of famous dogs worldwide—to show how Instagram has fundamentally changed the way we communicate, shop, eat, and travel. The book brings readers inside users’ strategies to craft their personal image and fame, explaining how the company’s product decisions have affected the structure of our society. From teenagers to the pope, No Filter tells the captivating story of how Instagram not only created a new industry but also changed our lives.

## Introduction - Introduction to the ultimate influencer
> _Consider that millions of people and brands have more Instagram followers than the New York Times has subscribers. Marketing through these people, who are basically running personal media companies through tastemaking, storytelling, and entertaining, is now a multibillion-dollar industry_

> :star: _By looking at the way commercial spaces, products, and even homes are designed, we can see Instagram's impact, in a way that we can't as easily see the impact of Facebook or Twitter. The San Francisco workspace I'm writing this book in, for example, has its library arranged not according to title or author, but cover color: the decision makes sense when prioritizing Instagram aesthetics over book discovery_

## Chapter 1 - Project Codename
> She worried Systrom would waste his potential if he gave everything up for somebody else's vision

Systrom's mentor from the entrepeneurship program he was attending to at Stanford, about the possibility of him joining Facebook as an early employee (at that point it didn't even had photos; that was the project Systrom was going to lead). It's crazy how turning down such a huge opportunity (building photos support at Facebook) lead to an even bigger opportunity (founding Instagram)

> A higher-quality tool wouldn't necessarily create better art. "You have to learn to love imperfection". [...] More important was the lesson that just because something is more technically complex doesn't mean it's better

> When going back to USA Systrom joined Odeo (a tech startup) as an intern. His mentor was a recent hire called Jack Dorsey (who would later become the CEO of Twitter).

It's funny how Kevin Systrom had a really close relationship with the founders of both Facebook and Twitter when the companies were still nothing.

> The team at Odeo was launching a new status update product, called Twttr, pronounced "twitter", with Dorsey as its CEO

> Master's degree in "symbolic systems" - the famous Stanford program for understanding the psychology of how humans interact with computers 

Sounds super interesting. More info: https://symsys.stanford.edu/

> Systrom thought of how scary it must have been for the team at Odeo to switch to building Twitter, but clearly that had been the right decision. What was their Twitter?

> [...] to ask first what problem they were solving, and then try to solve it in the simplest way possible.

> Systrom's argument to Dorsey, that the trendy HTML5 coding language would be a helpful differentiator in the marketplace, turned out to be wrong. They would have to make the app useful first, and add Android later, if they were lucky enough to become that popular

> Rise nor the founders thought there was a downside to the fact that filters, when used en masse, would give Instagrammers permission to present their reality as more interesting and beautiful than it actually was. That was exactly what would help make the product popular. Instagram posts would be art, and art was a form of commentary on life. The app would give people the gift of expression, but also escapism

> "It's so much work to tweet. There's a lot of pressure about what you're going to say. But it's so easy to post a photo"

> Instagram's early popularity was less about the technology and more about the psychology - about how it made people feel. The filters made reality look like art. And then, in cataloging that art, people would start to think about their lives differently, and themselves differently, and their place in society differently

> :star: Systrom wasn't as confident as he sounded. He had actually been nervous to meet Crowley, since Foursquare was the talk of the industry. Instagram's infrastructure was still struggling to support all the new users. He and Krieger weren't sleeping well. There were plenty of strong competitors. But pretending things were going more smoothly than they actually were was part of the job of being a startup CEO. Everyone needed to think you were on the right track. His posturing was perhaps analogous to the modern pressure Instagram would introduce - the pressure to post only the best photos, making life seem more perfect than it actually was.

Really important reminder: successful people also suffer from stress or uncertainty. They just work really hard to act like they don't.

## Chapter 2 - The Chaos of Success
> It was better to start with something minimalist, and then let priorities reveal themselves as users ran into trouble

> :star: Krieger, who owned much less of Instagram than Systrom did (40% vs 10%) embraced the hierarchy. He didn't want Systrom's job, and Systrom didn't want his. That's why it worked

> Only they could make that happen. "Other people won't always be in this for us". Systrom realized. They could trust each other, and that was basically it. Nobody else was going to have Instagram's best interests in mind.

Kevin Systrom after Andreesen-Horowitz, one of their investors, invested in a rival company too. 

> :star: "Kevin, let Bieber invest, or pay him for his content. Or else he'll stop using Instagram.
> Systrom had already decided that Instagram wouldn't be paying anyone for their content, since he wanted everyone to be spending time on Instagram because it was fun and useful, not for commercial reasons. He said no to paying Bieber or taking his investment.
> Bieber followed his agent's threat. But his on-and-off girlfriend, Selena Gomez, loved to use Instagram [...]. Soon Bieber was back on the app, continuing to overload the infrastructure, to the point where the company had to devote half a server just to his account activity. 

About Bieber asking for money to use Instagram and Systrom's rejection. It's specially impressive because when Bieber joined the app, Instagram experienced his fastest growth rate ever and his activity had a huge effect on the community, to the point where most of the time Bieber posted a picture the servers went down because of the huge amount of traffic interacting with it (liking/commenting)

## Chapter 3 - The surprise
> :star: He'd never done a deal this big and his nerves were getting to him

Amin Zounfonoun, Facebook's deals director, when the Instagram deal was about to be closed and the price had been decided. I love this quote because you would usually think that a high-level executive is super confident in everything that he does and always has everything under control, but here we can see him worried and having a bad time because of the responsibility. **If even someone so clearly prepared suffers Imposter's Syndrome, how I'm not going to have it too?**

> :star: "If we don't create the thing that kills Facebook, someone else will. The internet is not a friendly place. Things that don't stay relevant don't even get the luxury of leaving ruins. They disappear"

One of the pages of the Facebook employee handbook, explaining Zuckerberg's "paranoid leadership" philosophy

> [When he learned that Instagram had been sold to Facebook instead of Twitter] Jack Dorsey deleted the Instagram app and stopped posting altogether

Even founders of huge companies get personally affected by business moves. Sometimes they seem to be immune to all that stuff, but things like this prove that's not the case at all. They are also humans after all.

> [When the Instagram deal was announced] That day, Zuckerberg had posted a picture of Beast (his dog) on Instagram. His first time sharing on the app in almost a year

Small details

## Chapter 4 - The summer in limbo

:star: (to this chapter in general)

> Antitrust law was not written for modern acquisitions like Instagram. A traditional monopoly was a company with such a hold on its industry that it harmed others by fixing prices or controlling a supply chain. Facebook and Instagram presented no obvious consumer harm because their products were free to use, as long as people were willing to give up their data to the network.

> The regulators were shortsightedly looking at the current marketplace and ignoring what Facebook and Instagram had the potential to be in a few years or even months.

Tech progressed faster than law. As a consequence, the commitee allowed which now is one of the clearest cases of monopoly in the tech industry. One of the clearest examples of why it's **critical** that politicians (and therefore, law) constantly keep up to date.

Luckily enough, looks like things are changing. This tweet from @AOC a few months ago is the clearest explanation you can get:

> When our legislative bodies aren’t sufficiently responsive to tech, then that means we don’t have the tools required to protect people. This is partially why companies know way more about you than you may even be aware of - bc it’s legal, and Congress is struggling to keep up.
https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1288977153728622594

The chapter has really interesting thoughts about the monopoly evaluation process. It's too much to include everything here, so I would really recommend everyone to read the entire chapter if you get the chance.

## Chapter 5 - Move fast and break things

> :star:
> - This journey is only 1% finished
> - The riskiest thing is to take no risks
> - Done is better than perfect
> - Move fast and break things

> It would be easy to get complacent and think we've won every time we bring ourselves to a new level, but all that does is just decrease the chance we'll get to the next level after that

Facebook philosophy. It's inspiring to see that, despite they are incredibly successful, they keep pushing for more.

> :star: Facebook had learned that people would get mad about breaches of privacy and then forget about them because they actually enjoyed what they were seeing—after all, users were getting exactly what Facebook thought they wanted, based on their previous behavior. Usually, people calmed down. And if they didn’t stop being angry, Facebook could reverse its decisions or come up with a version of the product people weren’t as mad about. The riskiest thing is to take no risks.

Probably the last thing you want to hear about a company that posseses gigabytes of data about every single one of us

> At Facebook, the news feed was full of competing features. Every product manager working on every aspect of the social network—events, groups, friend requests, comments—wanted their team’s tool to be granted an opportunity for a red dot, or a push notification, so that they would get a fair shake at meeting their growth goals and getting a good performance review. The idea that one might not add a notification with a new feature was a foreign concept—Facebook championed growth at all costs.

One of the consequences of office politics and personal interests being more important than customers for some of the people in charge.

> Krieger and Systrom started to understand the strengths of their position: they could learn all of Facebook’s tricks, and then they could understand the pros and cons of those moves by looking at how Facebook’s own product had succeeded or failed. Then, hopefully, they could decide to take a different path if they thought it necessary.

> Three Instagram values
> - Community first
> - Simplicity matters
> - Inspire creativity

## Chapter 6 - Domination

> Systrom was competitive, but it was always very important to him to do things _the best way_. [...] Zuckerberg, on the other hand, was set on doing things _better than anyone else_. [...]
> Companies become a reflection of their founders. Systrom had created a place won the internet where the most interesting people who were the best at what they did could be followed by others, praised and emulated. [...] Zuckerberg had created the largest network of humans ever.

> [About the videos in the Instagram feed having a max length of 15-seconds] There was no Facebook-style optimization baked into that number of seconds. It was an artistic choice.

> [About Snapchat, and why it succeeded vs Instagram at first] They made something less stressful and more fun, and much more appealing to young people. “People are living with this massive burden of managing a digital version of themselves,”

> Snapchat’s appeal with teens was crucial. Teens, about to leave high school and enter the wider world, were quickly building networks that would serve as infrastructure for the rest of their lives. At that age, they were building new habits and amassing spending power without oversight from their parents, developing affinities for brands they’d have loyalty to for years. Facebook might have started with college students, but Zuckerberg knew it needed power among this younger cohort.

> Once Facebook purchased the VPN company, they could look at all the traffic flowing through the service and extrapolate data from it.

That moment when you use a VPN to keep your traffic secure, just to get all of it read by Facebook. Is that even legal?

> :star: When White resigned for the Snapchat COO job, it rattled Systrom’s confidence. He had spent so many days brainstorming with her, traveling with her, planning the business model with her guidance. Accepting her into the executive role was akin to embracing and trusting Facebook. Now he was, in a sense, paralyzed with doubt about his own decision-making, specifically around who he had decided to trust. Most of the people White had hired for Instagram were former Facebookers. After her departure, Systrom stopped holding question-and-answer meetings with staff for a while. For a couple months, he started showing up to work later, and paused some of his hiring plans.

Systrom had a great confident in one of his teammates, and losing her greatly affected him personally. Shows the importance of having close colleagues you can trust

> [About Internet.org] Zuckerberg launched an initiative to add more people to the internet, all of whom could be potential future Facebook users.o

Good reminder that even the things that Facebook does that seem nice, are probably just a way of getting more profit

## Chapter 7 - The new celebrity

> :star: Hilton had money, so in moments they really needed to control her message, they would use it. Moore would pay a paparazzo to wear a green scarf so Hilton would know exactly whose lens to look into when she stepped out of her house, out of a club, or, at one point, out of jail. Then Moore would anonymously broker a deal to sell the picture to a celebrity news site. “Then the publication would come back to us and ask for a comment—and the whole time they had no clue we were behind it,” Moore explained. “The paparazzi was essentially Paris’s daily Instagram post, and that reality show was the weekly Instagram story.”

About how (in the early 2000s, before Instagram) Paris Hilton and her agent controlled what bad photos and stories were published about her, by creating those themselves. Really interesting to see that the best way to control a bad narrative is to create it yourself.

> The lack of disclosure made the posts feel less like ads and more like helpful tips—and U.S. regulators were slow to catch on to the practice.

> The effect would depress some of the early Instagram employees, who had wanted so badly to build a community centered around the appreciation of art and creativity, and instead felt that they had built a mall.

About the start of branded content, and how 1) regulators were again behind the tech world 2) it was perceived inside Instagram

> :star: People in various cities came up to her, crying, telling her they were struggling with depression or anxiety and that Tuna was bringing them joy. “That was the first time that I realized how much weight these posts had for people,”

Courtney Dasher, owner of the account [@tunameltsmyheart](https://www.instagram.com/tunameltsmyheart/) about the effect its photos had in people. For reference, the account posts cute photos about Tuna, an overbite chihuahua 

I found it a great example of how tech has the power to improve the life of someone thousands of miles away, even by doing something so innocent as allowing you to post cute photos of your dog

> “We were used to going through a very long laborious process of organizing shoots and productions on those shoots, and a classic media buying program working with magazines,” Bailey explained. “Six or nine months later you finally saw that image in a magazine. With Instagram, the fact that we could hire our own photographers, our own team, and within minutes it could be online and we would have dialogue directly with people who were interested in our brand, was just incredible.”

Christopher Bailey, Burberry's Chief Creative Officer, about their switch from advertising on printed magazines to running an Instagram account. He was the one proposing that strategy, and its success was one of the reasons why a few months later he was promoted to CEO

> Since Facebook had been the first social media company to go public, the company trained Wall Street on the appropriate valuation model—the one that benefited Facebook most, that every single move it made was focused on driving. Facebook’s strategy wasn’t about buzz. It was all about growth.

> Systrom told employees they were now dealing with not just one user community, but several, and they couldn’t be good at reaching all of them. So they'd need to choose

The importance of focus

> David Swain, the Instagram communications chief, had two things he liked to say about the media strategy. One was “extend the honeymoon”: keep people feeling good about Instagram for as long as possible in the wake of the Facebook marriage. The other was “don’t fuck it up”: avoid losing user trust, the way Facebook had.

> [Additional Facebook apps like Mentions or Paper] they were technological solutions to a problem Instagram was solving with human interaction and curation.

> Instagram’s power lay not in what was posted there, but in how those posts made people feel.

## Chapter 8 - The pursuit of the Insta-worthy

> :star: “Facebook buying Instagram was like putting it in a microwave. In a microwave, the food gets hotter faster, but you can easily ruin the dish.”
> —FORMER INSTAGRAM EXECUTIVE


> [Kevin Systrom] He wanted to recruit the best talent, but didn’t want them to bring over Facebook’s grow-at-all-costs values.

> Unlike Facebook, where employees looked for technical solutions that reached the most users, Instagram solved problems in a way that was intimate, creative, and relationship-based, sometimes even at the individual level if the user was important enough to warrant it.

> :star: Facebook employees had seen their stock options soar in value from rapid growth that came, in part, from not judging their users’ choices. They would complain that the Instagram team had the luxury of making different decisions, taking Facebook’s resources for granted with an attitude of superiority.

_Standing on the shoulders of giants_

> :star: Barnieh watched new cafes all around the world adopt aesthetics that were popular on Instagram [...] In their quest to look modern, he thought they all ended up looking the same, the way airports and corporate offices all look the same. The public was coming to a consensus about what kinds of designs were Instagrammable.

> They would promote what they felt was their standard fare, like embroidery artists and funny-looking pets. And they would avoid posting anything that perpetuated some of the new unhealthy trends on the app. They would never post a photo of anybody near a cliff, no matter how beautiful, because they knew that gaining a following on Instagram was becoming so desirable that people were risking their lives for perfect shots. They would avoid promoting yoga and fitness accounts, so that they wouldn’t seem to approve of a certain body type and make their users feel inadequate—or worse, aroused. They would also avoid promoting accounts that showed off expensive experiences, like ones from travel bloggers. But sometimes they wrestled with what to celebrate and what to ignore. Should they talk publicly about the #promposal trend, for instance? Teens were developing grand Instagram-worthy gestures to ask each other to the school dance. Was that good for Instagram or perpetuating a pressured culture? And how did they feel about meme accounts? These were wildly popular accounts that weren’t about photography at all, but were mostly screenshots of jokes from Tumblr and Twitter. Some Instagram employees were uncomfortable with memes, but also with selfies, bikini shots, and other behaviors that had become mainstream on Instagram, against their artistic sensibilities.

About the Community team at Instagram, and how they decided what to publicize on the [@instagram](https://www.instagram.com/instagram/) account. The publications were hand-picked, which was easy at first, but as they grew they realised that with great power comes great responsibility

> Liz Perle [...]

Can't copy the entire section here, but there's a really interesting story about how she successfully combined gut and data

> The strategy was a success. Young people were obsessed with Instagram. In 2015, 50 percent of teens in the U.S. were on the app.

And that's the result of that story. It didn't happen by chance, it was an incredibly well planned strategy

> "You become a product of what everyone else wants, and not who you’re supposed to be."

Janelle Bull, a therapist at Anchor Psychology in Silicon Valley, explaining how Instagram was starting to affect the everyday life of regular people

> Anyone losing an argument with Facebook had a last resort: running a test to see what the data showed. When Horsley tested whether Facebook would lose money by increasing the quality requirements, he miraculously found that the opposite was true. Advertisers took their ads more seriously, and spent more. The change was approved.

About Hunter Horsley, an employee on the team that worked on the initial version of Instagram ads, who was having a discussion with Facebook employees about the appropriate ad size. Initially the Facebook employees rejected their proposal, but he used data to prove it was the right one. Great example of the importance of being really data-driven

> [Systrom] He thought that if they changed anything, it would have to be because it made Instagram better, not because it helped Facebook hit a growth metric.

## Chapter 9 - The Snapchat problem
